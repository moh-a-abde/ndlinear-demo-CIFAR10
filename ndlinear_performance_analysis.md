## Discussion

### Parameter Efficiency Analysis

NdLinear demonstrates superior parameter efficiency by achieving 111.59% better accuracy per parameter. This efficiency gain stems from NdLinear's factorized approach, which preserves the multi-dimensional structure of the data while reducing parameter count.

The improved efficiency has significant practical implications:
- Reduced memory footprint for deployment on edge devices
- Lower computational requirements during inference
- Better scalability to larger models and datasets

### Architectural Advantages of NdLinear

NdLinear's performance can be attributed to several architectural advantages:

1. **Structural preservation:** By preserving the tensor structure (8×8×32), NdLinear retains spatial relationships that would be lost in flattening operations
2. **Factorized transformations:** Mode-specific transformations reduce parameter redundancy while maintaining expressiveness
3. **Regularization effect:** The factorized structure acts as an implicit regularizer, potentially improving generalization

### Future Directions

Future work should explore:
1. Scaling NdLinear to larger models and datasets
2. Quantifying computational efficiency gains during training and inference

## Conclusion

The NdLinear approach provides a compelling alternative to standard linear layers, offering significant parameter efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. In my CIFAR-10 experiment, NdLinear achieves equal performance while using 55.1% fewer parameters than the baseline model.

These results highlight the potential of structure-preserving transformations like NdLinear for building more efficient deep learning models, particularly in resource-constrained environments where model size and computational efficiency are critical concerns.
